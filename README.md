# binfo

Purpose of this tool is to use it as reference for my journey as a programmer and to get better at Python 3.

Challenge 1: To capture this flag you will need to collect the following information about the CTF VM. All strings should be wide character.

Ofcourse without UAC bypass, you gotta do that yo'self xD
User Name, Computer Name, MAC Addresses, List of all mounted volumes, Process List
And some extra stuff added.

Usage:
binfo.py <leave blank for usage information>
